# Simple Linear Equations Solver

Simple and beginner-friendly Linear Equations Solve written in C++. The program runs on the terminal and was supposed to leverage and improve C++ knowledge.

## Usage

```bash
# compile and run
g++ main.cpp
./a.out

# enter parameters
a: 2
b: 5
c: -2

# get the equation formatted 
2xÂ²+5x-2=0

# choose the next step
What would you like to do with the equation?
---> 1. Discriminant
---> 2. Roots
---> 3. Both Discriminant and Roots
---> 4. Set new equation
---> 5. Exit
3

# output
Discriminant: 41.00
Roots: Roots for discriminant > 0:
[0.35, -2.85]
```
